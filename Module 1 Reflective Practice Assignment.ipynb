    "1) **Use Jupyter Notebook:**  We've provided a Jupyter Notebook environment throughout the course for Reflective Activities, as this allows you to run both R Code and write standard text responses in what are called Jupyter Notebook cells below. To use the Jupyter Notebook, add your responses in the indicated areas marked with '''# YOUR CODE HERE'''. You can run your R Code and cells by selecting 'Cell -> Run Cells' in the upper toolbar, or the keyboard shortcut SHIFT + RETURN/ENTER\n",

They translate and apply well to solve real world problems(as stated in lecture notes and quizzes). Conditional Probability though robust was harder to connect the dots with between conception and problem-solving. I look forward to lessons building on from the concepts covered in Module 1."
